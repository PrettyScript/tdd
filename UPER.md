<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>I have to create a small application that will 
print out an itemized receipt of a customer's purchase. 
I have to apply my knowledge of OOP, OOD and TDD practices
in order to make a fully functioning application in a timely
manner. One of the biggest obstacles that I will have to overcome
is learning TDD and creating test cases that are relevant and 
reliable for the application. </p>
 
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learn TDD</li>
    <li>Utilize JUnit</li>
    <li>Apply OOP pillars in application</li>
    <li>Create a UML</li>
    <li>I'll keep in mind the OOD principles when creating the application
        I plan to create an application that works and has passing test cases,
        then I will refactor to adhere to the OOD principles
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Code easy to read and to maintain (i.e. Clean code)</li>
    <li>Object-oriented design patterns (OOD)</li>
    <li>Object-oriented design principles (SOLID) (Expandable Design)</li>
    <li>Unit testing (TDD)</li>
</ul>
*the source code must be submitted without its byte code
